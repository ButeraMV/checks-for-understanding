## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What's your favorite project management tool?

My favorite tool is Waffle. I like the layout of it and it is not as heavy as Pivotal Tracker.

2. Why do we create staging environments?

Same as production, except not front facing. Allows us to ensure that all tests will pass in prod.

3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?

What the program/app does, how to use/install, known bugs, feature descriptions, author, license

4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?

Make sure that everything can be tabbed through and doesn't use hard to distinguish colors.

5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?

XSS, Privilege Escalation

6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?

Allows us to constantly have the production up to date, without having to worry about shipping broken code (if testing is solid)

7. What are some pros/cons of using ReactJS as a frontend tool?

Pros: Allows for interesting behavior on the dom
Cons: Another thing to learn

#### Review  

8. What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?

Commit often, work on branches and merge master in before doing a pr, meaningful commit messages.

9. Describe each of the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming.

Abstraction: Forming a problem into classes and objects
Encapsulation: Putting things where they need to be, which breaks out methods into private methods, modules, etc
Inheritance: Being able to generate new things from a base class.
Polymorphism: Ability to have things change, even if they are from the same base class.

10. What's a module in Ruby? What's the difference between a class and a module? What are some good use cases for modules?

A module is like a class but does not hold state or get initialized. A good use is for breaking out methods that don't need to live on a class.
